## Shaun's Business Notes App

## About
People are busy and using complicated schedulers can only serve to add more stress. I developed a simple, straightforward scheduler a user can use to keep track of their busy lives. Users can add new notes and view old, saved notes with ease.

## Purpose
To practice node application and different api requests while connecting them to a pre-built front-end.
